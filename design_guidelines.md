# Shreeram Computers Website Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from modern educational technology websites with a focus on dark gel aesthetics and gradient design patterns found in premium tech platforms.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Dark Blue: 240 80% 15%
- Deep Purple: 270 70% 20%
- Accent Purple: 280 60% 40%

**Gradient Combinations:**
- Primary gradient: Dark blue to deep purple (240 80% 15% to 270 70% 20%)
- Accent gradient: Deep purple to accent purple (270 70% 20% to 280 60% 40%)
- Subtle overlay: Semi-transparent purple for glass morphism effects

**Background Treatments:**
- Primary background: Very dark blue-black (240 30% 8%)
- Card backgrounds: Semi-transparent dark with gradient borders
- Glass morphism effects with backdrop blur and subtle gradients

### B. Typography
**Font Families:**
- Primary: Inter (Google Fonts) - clean, modern sans-serif for headings and body text
- Secondary: JetBrains Mono for any code snippets or technical content

**Hierarchy:**
- Hero headings: Bold, 3xl-4xl sizes with gradient text effects
- Section headings: Semibold, xl-2xl sizes in white
- Body text: Regular weight, base size in light gray
- Accent text: Medium weight with purple gradient highlights

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Units:** Tailwind units of 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 for consistent rhythm
- Container padding: px-6 to px-8
- Section spacing: py-16 to py-24
- Component spacing: gap-6 to gap-8
- Card padding: p-6 to p-8

### D. Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Dark glass-morphism navbar with backdrop blur
- Purple gradient hover states for navigation links
- Sticky positioning with subtle shadow

**Cards & Containers:**
- Dark semi-transparent backgrounds with gradient borders
- Rounded corners (rounded-xl to rounded-2xl)
- Subtle purple glow effects on hover
- Glass morphism with backdrop-blur-md

**Buttons:**
- Primary: Purple gradient fill with white text
- Secondary: Outline style with gradient borders and glass background
- Glass buttons on hero sections with blurred backgrounds

**Hero Section:**
- Large gradient background spanning full viewport
- Diagonal gradient overlays for visual interest
- Central content with supporting illustration/imagery
- Call-to-action buttons with prominent gradient styling

**Service/Course Cards:**
- Grid layout with hover animations
- Gradient borders and subtle glow effects
- Glass morphism backgrounds
- Purple accent highlights for important information

### E. Visual Effects
**Glass Morphism:**
- Backdrop blur effects on cards and overlays
- Semi-transparent backgrounds with gradient borders
- Subtle shadow and glow combinations

**Gradients:**
- Diagonal gradients for section backgrounds
- Radial gradients for accent elements
- Text gradients for headings and highlights
- Border gradients for card outlines

## Images
**Hero Section:** Large background illustration or abstract tech-themed imagery with dark blue/purple overlay gradients to maintain text readability.

**Service Icons:** Modern, minimalist icons in outline style that can be filled with gradient colors.

**Course Thumbnails:** Professional imagery related to computer education with dark overlays and purple accent elements.

## Key Design Principles
1. **Dark Elegance:** Sophisticated dark theme with premium feel
2. **Gradient Harmony:** Consistent blue-to-purple gradient family throughout
3. **Glass Depth:** Layered glass morphism for modern visual hierarchy
4. **Professional Trust:** Clean typography and structured layouts for educational credibility
5. **Interactive Delight:** Subtle hover effects and smooth transitions without distraction
